# Contributor Code of Conduct

We would like to develop in a positive environment so please try to:

* be nice and respectful
* give constructive criticism and take it gracefully if given
* show empathy to others

We'll hope that this small guideline in combination with common sense will suffice.

If you have questions feel free to contact us at <info@openatlas.eu>
