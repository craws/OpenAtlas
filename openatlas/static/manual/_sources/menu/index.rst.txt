Most information that historians work with comes from historical documents. Usually, the first step
is to digitize the **sources** so that they are easier to work with. Often the next step is to
identify bits of information like **persons**, **events** and **places** and map them so that you
can ask questions like: *Where was this person in the course of his life?* or
*Who participated at an event?*

The menu structure reflects that workflow.
