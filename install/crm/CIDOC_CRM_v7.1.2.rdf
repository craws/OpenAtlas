CIDOC CRM v7.1.2 implemented in RDFS

This is the implementation incorporating to the decisions of the 53rd CRM-SIG meeting (May 2022)
and has been approved for official use.
Note that this is NOT a definition of the CIDOC CRM, but a CIDOC CRM compatible implementation
of an RDF Schema derived from the authoritative release of the CIDOC CRM v7.1.2 on June 2022
https://cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-7.1.2 by an automated algorithm. It is intended for an
assumed majority of uses. Depending on the application, users may create adequate extensions 
compatible with the logical definitions of the CIDOC CRM.

Encoding Rules:
1. The RDF spelling rules do not allow blanks. Hence we have replaced them by underscores.
   For instance "E63_Beginning_of_Existence" or "P2i_is_type_of".

2. RDF does not allow to instantiate properties beginning from a range value.
   Therefore, each CRM property is represented as two RDFS properties.
   For instance "P2 has type (is type of)" is represented as:
   "P2_has_type" for the domain to range direction and "P2i_is_type_of" for the range to domain direction.

3. The primitive values "E60 Number", "E61 Time Primitive", "E62 String", "E94 Space Primitive" and 
   "E95 Spacetime Primitive" referred in the Model for formal completeness are interpreted as rdfs:literal.

4. RDF does not support properties of properties, therefore, users may create their own
   subProperties for CRM properties that have a type property such as "P3 has note":
   Instead of P3 has note (P3-1 has type : parts description) declare
   <rdf:Property rdf:about="P3_parts_description">
      <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="E1_CRM_Entity"/>
      <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"/>
      <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="P3_has_note"/>
   </rdf:Property>

5. Scope notes are represented as <rdfs:comment> elements.

6. In addition this encoding contains labels in languages different from English, 
   which are taken from translations of previous versions of the CIDOC CRM.    

7. Any other differences in labels, scope notes  and semantic relationships of this encoding 
   to the authoritative definition of the CIDOC CRM v7.1.2 (June 2022) are not intended transfer errors. 
   FORTH appreciates your feed-back on such errors.

8. CRM time extension 1.0 Encoded in RDFS (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)
   Since the Time Primitive of the CRM can not directly be implemented in RDF Triple Stores, we define in this extension
   of 4 properties replacing P81 and P82 adequately using xsd:dateTime. 
   Property P81 is dedicated for modeling the Time-Span's maximum known temporal extent i.e. ongoing_throughout. 
   Property P82 is for modeling the minimum outer bounds of events i.e. at_some_time_within. 
   P81 has its time interval redefined by P81a and P81b. Similarly, we redefine P82 by P82a and P82b.

## RDFS Generation Policies

### Sources

Policies followed for the RDFS implementation of CIDOC v.7.1.2 were created w.r.t.:

- Implementing the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model in RDF (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Resources/implementing-the-cidoc-conceptual-reference-model-in-rdf)
- How to implement CRM Time in RDF (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)
- CIDOC-CRM SIG feedback and the general guidelines:
  - Each property is declared twice, forward and backwards, unless no inverse name is defined in parentheses, or domain or range is interpreted as literal
  - All Primitive Values become rdfs:Literal
  - All IsA declarations from/to and between Primitive values are ignored

### Policies

#### **A. CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS**

The CIDOC-CRM model defines classes, that in Triple Stores are typically implemented as primitive values. These classes are all subclasses of `E59 Primitive Value` and in RDFS they are interpreted as Literal. There are some classes in the CIDOC-CRM model that are both subclasses of `E59 Primitive Value` and E41 Appellation. So far we have followed the decision by CRM-SIG in "Issue 394: Solution for Dualism of E41 Appellation and rdfs:label" in 28-11-2018 wrt the question whether these classes should be implemented as rdfs:Class or still be interpreted as rdfs:Literal.

In this version we have followed the following policy regarding CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS:

> A1. CIDOC Classes that are subClasses of `E59 Primitive Value` are interpreted as rdfs:Literal regardless of whether they are also subClasses of another Class.

As a result, the following CIDOC classes were not defined in RDFS:

- `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E60 Number`
- `E61 Time Primitive`
- `E62 String`
- `E94 Space Primitive`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive`

Additionally, the following isA relationships were not defined in RDFS:

- `E59 Primitive Value` `subClassOf` `E1 CRM Entity`
- `E60 Number` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E61 Time Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E61 Time Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E62 String` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E94 Space Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E94 Space Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`

#### **B. CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS**

The decisions in policy A affect the implementation of CIDOC Properties in RDFS. A property cannot define an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:domain, and the backwards direction of a property with an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:range cannot be created for the exact same reason.

Further, the property ranges defined as rdfs:Literal in this implementation do not inherit the properties of the superclasses defined in the CIDOC Model. A separate guideline will describe how to instantiate such properties if at all needed.

Another aspect considered for the implementation of properties in RDFS is whether a distinct inverse property definition should be provided.

In this version we followed the following policies regarding CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS:

> B1. CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever no inverse name for the property has been specified in parentheses in the official CIDOC documentation and property domain is not equal with property range.

As a result, the following properties do not define an inverse direction.

- `E1 CRM Entity. P3 has note: E62 String`
- `E19 Physical Object. P57 has number of parts: E60 Number`
- `E52 Time-Span. P79 beginning is qualified by: E62 String`
- `E52 Time-Span. P80 end is qualified by: E62 String`
- `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`
- `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`
- `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`
- `E53 Place. P171 at some place within: E94 Space Primitive`
- `E53 Place. P172 contains: E94 Space Primitive`
- `E90 Symbolic Object. P190 has symbolic content: E62 String`

> B2. CIDOC Property forward direction is **not** defined whenever property domain is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Similarly, CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever property range is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Further, the instances of classes interpreted as rdfs:Literal, cannot express in RDFs their **inherited** properties that could be expressed according to CIDOC Model.

As a result,

a) The following **direct forward direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:

- `E95 Spacetime Primitive. P169 defines spacetime volume (spacetime volume is defined by): E92 Spacetime Volume`
- `E61 Time Primitive. P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span`

b) The following **direct backwards direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:

- `E94 Space Primitive. P168i defines place (place is defined by): E53 Place`

> B3. Whenever no backwards/inverse property name is specified and property domain matches with property range, then the forward/direct property direction should be used for **both** directions and **no backwards/inverse property** needs to be defined.

As a result, we did not implement a separate backwards/inverse direction for the following CIDOC Properties:

- `E53 Place. P121 overlaps with: E53 Place`
- `E53 Place. P122 borders with: E53 Place`
- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with: E92 Spacetime Volume`
- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P133 is spatiotemporally separated from: E92 Spacetime Volume`

Additionally, all aforementioned redundant backwards/inverse CIDOC Property direction references, are replaced by the respective direct/forward CIDOC Property direction.

- The hierarchical link of  `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132i` was replaced with `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132`.

#### **C. Labels and appellations**

CIDOC-CRM version 7.1.2 defines the below subpropertyOf relations:

- `P168 place is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`
- `P169i spacetime volume is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`
- `P170i time is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`

The range of P168, P169i and P170i is `E94 Space Primitive`, `E95 Spacetime Primitive` and `E61 Time Primitive` respectively, which are all subclasses of `E41 Appellation` and interpreted as `rdfs:Literal` in RDFS, i.e. these three properties are datatype properties. However, the P1 property has range E41 Appellation, i.e. this property is an object property. Since OWL 2 distinguishes between object subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Object_Subproperties), data subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Data_Subproperties) and annotation subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Annotation_Subproperties), and also in OWL-DL the subject and object of a subproperty statement must be either both datatype properties or both object properties (see here (https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#subPropertyOf-def)), we do not include these three subPropertyOf relations in the provided RDFS implementation to avoid inconsistencies when reasoning with OWL 2 and OWL DL. Instead, we provide them in a separate ‘supplementary’ RDFS file which one can use if such inconsistencies are not expected.

In addition, since in the current practice, the property `rdfs:label` is widely used to denote appellations (see CRM-SIG Issue 394 (http://cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-394-solution-for-dualism-of-e41-appellation-and-rdfslabel)), the following `subPropertyOf` relation was also included in the supplementary RDFS file:

- `rdfs:label` subPropertyOf `P1 is identified by`

Note that according to the RDF Schema 1.1 specification, the domain (or range) of a property does not necessarily need to be 'subClassOf' or 'equal' to the domain (or range) of its superproperties. By including this subproperty relation, one can either directly use `rdfs:label` for providing a non-URI identifier/appellation for an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` for associating an additional URI-identifier with an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` and create an intermediate node (i.e. a URI-identifier for instance of `E41_Appellation`) for providing more detailed information about this appellation.

#### **D. Implementing Value Intervals**

The following are property pairs needed to simulate the interval-valued primitive values foreseen by the CRM:

> D1. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'maximum known temporal extent' boundaries specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.

As a result, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E52 Time-Span. P81a end of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)
- `E52 Time-Span. P81b begin of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)

> D2. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'minimum outer bounds' specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.

Consequently, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E52 Time-Span. P82a begin of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)
- `E52 Time-Span. P82b end of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)

> D3. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`, for the upper and lower boundaries specification of `E60 Number`.

Consequently, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E54 Dimension. P90a has lower value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)
- `E54 Dimension. P90b has upper value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)

#### **E. Multiple ISA custom declaration Classes**

The following are declarations of frequently used multiple instantiations as classes with respective multiple IsA (so far only one):

> E1. addition of a new class, defined as subClassOf `E41 Appellation` and `E33 Linguistic Object`, for all Appellations being regarded
specific to or characteristic for a language group and being described indirectly via a URI.

As a result, we have created the following class definition:

- `E33_E41_Linguistic_Appellation` subClass of `E33_Linguistic_Object` and `E41_Appellation`

#### **F. Translations and Scope notes**

> F1. **Translations** Each RDFS Class or Property definition is accompanied by a set of translations expressed as rdfs:labels separated by xml:lang tags. The translation label used for each language is **the most recent** still **valid** translation. Still valid translation may be interpreted in the following ways:

- The English label of the `CurrentVersion` that the current RDFS file is referring to is *almost equal* (accepting only differences regarding multiple spaces) to the English label of the `TranslationVersion` that the translated label was created for. For example, in order to accept a translation for `E22 Human-Made Object` in the CurrentVersion (7.1.2) we should have a translation for E22 that was created based on a CIDOC version that used the same name for E22. The class name of E22 was changed from `E22 Man-Made Object` to `E22 Human-Made Object` in version 6.2.7. So the only **valid** translations would be these that were created based on version 6.2.7 or later. Currently no such translation has been created, so `E22 Human-Made Object` in CurrentVersion (7.1.2) does not define any translation in the RDFS file.

- Another option is to qualify translations as **valid** based on the scope note comparison of `CurrentVersion` and `TranslationVersion`. Since scope notes include formatting information, the comparison should ignore formatting changes.

Currently in this version we follow the option to qualify translations as valid based on the comparison of the respective labels in the corresponding CIDOC versions.

> F2. **Scope notes** are defined as rdfs:comment and include only the text of the official CIDOC-CRM version in English language. Since scope notes are not just simple texts but include formatting data, a simple removal of the formatting data does not always produce a readable format. Therefore we followed the below simple conventions for the transformation of CIDOC-CRM scope note text into a readable rdfs:comment:

- Each Paragraph defines a new line
- Each element in an unordered list defines a new line
- Each element in an ordered list defines a new line prefixed with `'{order}. '`
- Each superscript text is separated from its base with `'-'`
- Each subscript text is separated from its base with `'_'` (none found)

> F3. **Scope notes of Inverse Properties**. Scope notes for the inverse/backwards direction of properties are not defined as they are covered by the definition of the direct/forward direction definition. Whenever the direct/forward property direction of a property `Pxxx` is not defined due to policy **B1**, then its scope note is used as scope note for the inverse/backwards property `Pxxxi`, and labeled as `Scope note for 'Pxxx':`.

As a result, the direct/forward property definition was used for the rdfs:comment definition of

- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P169i spacetime volume is defined by: rdfs:Literal`
- `E52 Time-Span. P170i time is defined by: rdfs:Literal`

Identification by name or appellation, and in particular by a preferred identifier
Classification by type, allowing further refinement of the specific subclass an instance belongs to

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of E4 Periods and E5 Events, which happen over a limited extent in time. This extent in time must be contiguous, i.e., without gaps. In case the defining kinds of phenomena for an instance of E2 Temporal Entity cease to happen, and occur later again at another time, we regard that the former instance of E2 Temporal Entity has ended and a new instance has come into existence. In more intuitive terms, the same event cannot happen twice.
In some contexts, such phenomena are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item and is an abstract class that typically has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises the states of objects characterised by a certain condition over a time-span.
An instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of any material object or feature during a specific instance of E52 Time-Span. In general, the time-span for which a certain condition can be asserted may be shorter than the real time-span, for which this condition held.
The nature of that condition can be described using P2 has type. For example, the instance of E3 Condition State “condition of the SS Great Britain between 22-nd September 1846 and 27-th August 1847” can be characterized as an instance “wrecked” of E55 Type.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.
It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.
Often, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e., an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e., an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.
As the actual extent of an instance of E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.
Whether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.
Consequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the time-span covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However, it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.
We model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr &amp;amp; Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, we can discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.
Typical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.
A geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.
Another specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises distinct, delimited and coherent processes and interactions of a material nature, in cultural, social or physical systems, involving and affecting instances of E77 Persistent Item in a way characteristic of the kind of process. Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.
While the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.
The effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.
While instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.
Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.
Some destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity. Intentional destruction may be documented by classifying the event as both an instance of E6 Destruction and of E7 Activity.
The decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified is context sensitive:
1. If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as an instance of E6 Destruction.
2. An event should also be documented as an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.
3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as an instance of E11 Modification.</rdfs:comment>

The class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of right. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:
1. the beginning of ownership

It may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example by annexation or field collection.

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises transfers of the physical custody or the legal responsibility for the physical custody of objects. The recording of the donor or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient.
Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:
1. the beginning of custody (there is no previous custodian)
2. the end of custody (there is no subsequent custodian)
3. the transfer of custody (transfer from one custodian to the next)
4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source (the previous custodian is unknown)
5. the declared loss of an object (the current or subsequent custodian is unknown)
In the event that only a single kind of transfer of custody occurs, either the legal responsibility for the custody or the actual physical possession of the object but not both, this difference should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of).
The sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody be in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.
The interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.
Theft is a specific case of illegal transfer of custody.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises instances of E7 Activity that are undertaken to create, alter or change instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.
This class includes the production of an item from raw materials and other so far undocumented objects. It also includes the conservation treatment of an object.
Since the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in an instance of E11 Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.
An activity undertaken on an object which was designed to alter it, but which, in fact, it did not in any seemingly significant way (such as the application of a solvent during conservation which failed to dissolve any part of the object), is still considered as an instance of E11 Modification. Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.
If the instance of E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items.
It specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.
This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event.
An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises the actions of making assertions about one property of an object or any single relation between two items or concepts. The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned): E55 Type.
For example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g., the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.
This class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact, that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.
All properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.
All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through a subclass of E13 Attribute Assignment are characterised as "short cuts" of a path via this subclass. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action of assertion or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities that result in the allocation of an identifier to an instance of E1 CRM Entity. Instances of E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.
Examples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.
The fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises actions measuring quantitative physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic, objective procedure of direct observation of particular states of physical reality.
An instance of E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as "carbon-14 dating" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.
Regardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for): should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, human-made or natural.
Depending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CIDOC CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.
An instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space at any instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. For the purpose of more detailed descriptions of the presence of an instance of E18 Physical Thing in space and time it can be associated with its specific instance of E92 Spacetime Volume by the property P196 defines (is defined by).
The CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states, as long as they are not confined in an identifiable way for an identifiable minimal time-span.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises all persistent physical items of any size that are purposely created by human activity. This class comprises, besides others, Human-Made objects, such as a sword, and Human-Made features, such as rock art. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.
Instances of Human-Made thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even Human-Made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.
Whereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new Human-Made thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as physical Human-Made things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it Human-Made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of a physical Human-Made thing may continue to be non-Human-Made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.
This definition coincides with the definition of "fiat objects" (Smith &amp;amp; Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects”.</rdfs:comment>

The production of such information may have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.
Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.
They cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost.</rdfs:comment>

Instances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and sequences or depend on others.
This is modelled using P69 has association with (is associated with): E29 Design or Procedure.
Designs or procedures can be seen as one of the following

2. A schema of the products that result from their application.
3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo da Vinci’s famous plans for flying machines.

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises identifiable expressions in natural language or languages.
Instances of E33 Linguistic Object can be expressed in many ways: e.g., as written texts, recorded speech or sign language. However, the CIDOC CRM treats instances of E33 Linguistic Object independently from the medium or method by which they are expressed. Expressions in formal languages, such as computer code or mathematical formulae, are not treated as instances of E33 Linguistic Object by the CIDOC CRM. These should be modelled as instances of E73 Information Object.
In general, an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may also contain non-linguistic information, often of artistic or aesthetic value. Only in cases in which the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object can completely be expressed by a series of binary-encoded symbols, its content may be documented within a respective knowledge base by the property P190 has symbolic content: E62 String. Otherwise, it should be understood as an identifiable digital resource only available independently from the respective knowledge base.
In other cases, such as pages of an illuminated manuscript or recordings containing speech in a language supported by a writing system, the linguistic part of the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may be documented within a respective knowledge base in a note by P3 has note: E62 String. Otherwise, it may be described using the property P165 incorporates (is incorporated in): E73 Information Object as a different object with its own identity.</rdfs:comment>

Titles are proper noun phrases or verbal phrases, and should not be confused with generic object names such as “chair”, “painting” or “book” (the latter are common nouns that stand for instances of E55 Type). Titles may be assigned by the creator of the work itself, or by a social group.
This class also comprises the translations of titles that are used as surrogates for the original titles in different social contexts.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises the intellectual or conceptual aspects of recognisable marks, images and other visual works.
This class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of a visual item, but the underlying prototype. For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.
The class E36 Visual Item provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing that carry the same visual qualities (symbols, marks or images etc.). The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Human-Made Thing and depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises signs, either meaningful or not, or arrangements of signs following a specific syntax, that are used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class or category within a certain context.
Instances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but instead by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it denotes.
Different languages may use different appellations for the same thing, such as the names of major cities. Some appellations may be formulated using a valid noun phrase of a particular language. In these cases, the respective instances of E41 Appellation should also be declared as instances of E33 Linguistic Object. Then the language using the appellation can be declared with the property P72 has language: E56 Language.
Instances of E41 Appellation may be used to identify any instance of E1 CRM Entity and sometimes are characteristic for instances of more specific subclasses E1 CRM Entity, such as for instances of E52 Time-Span (for instance “dates”), E39 Actor, E53 Place or E28 Conceptual Object. Postal addresses and E-mail addresses are characteristic examples of identifiers used by services transporting things between clients.
Even numerically expressed identifiers for extents in space or time are also regarded as instances of E41 Appellation, such as Gregorian dates or spatial coordinates, even though they allow for determining some time or location by a known procedure starting from a reference point and by virtue of that fact play a double role as instances of E59 Primitive Value.
E41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end and a duration.
Instances of E52 Time-Span have no semantic connotations about phenomena happening within the temporal extent they represent. They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the “time-line” of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.
Some instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr &amp;amp; Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which we can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.
Some instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr &amp;amp; Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span.
When used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it will nevertheless describe them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else is known.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises extents in the natural space we live in, in particular on the surface of the Earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. They may serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or other areas of interest. Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.
The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place. This may be documented using the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e., by points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values etc.
An instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluninescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.
The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.
Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises concepts denoted by terms from thesauri and controlled vocabularies used to characterize and classify instances of CIDOC CRM classes. Instances of E55 Type represent concepts in contrast to instances of E41 Appellation which are used to name instances of CIDOC CRM classes.
E55 Type is the CIDOC CRM’s interface to domain specific ontologies and thesauri. These can be represented in the CIDOC CRM as subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e., instances of E55 Type linked via P127 has broader term (has narrower term): E55 Type. Such hierarchies may be extended with additional properties.</rdfs:comment>

Instances of E57 Material may denote properties of matter before its use, during its use, and as incorporated in an object, such as ultramarine powder, tempera paste, reinforced concrete. Discrete pieces of raw-materials kept in museums, such as bricks, sheets of fabric, pieces of metal, should be modelled individually in the same way as other objects. Discrete used or processed pieces, such as the stones from Nefer Titi's temple, should be modelled as parts (cf. P46 is composed of (forms part of): E18 Physical Thing).

An instance of E73 Information Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
Instances of E73 Information Object of a linguistic nature should be declared as instances of the E33 Linguistic Object subclass. Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass.

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises any gatherings or organizations of human individuals or groups that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.
A gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group. Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises items that have persistent characteristics of structural nature substantially related to their identity and their integrity, sometimes known as “endurants” in philosophy. Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names.
Instances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time.
The more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols.
The main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.
An instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained (“curated” and “preserved,” in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan. Typical instances of curated holdings are museum collections, archives, library holdings and digital libraries. A digital library is regarded as an instance of E18 Physical Thing because it requires keeping physical carriers of the electronic content.
Items may be added or removed from an E78 Curated Holding in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Curated Holding often referred to with the name of the E78 Curated Holding (e.g., “The Wallace Collection decided…”).
Collective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Curated Holding. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.</rdfs:comment>

Typical scenarios include the attachment of an accessory, the integration of a component, the addition of an element to an aggregate object, or the accessioning of an object into a curated instance of E78 Curated Holding. Both the E18 Physical Thing being augmented and the E18 Physical Thing that is being added are treated as separate identifiable wholes prior to the instance of E79 Part Addition. Following the addition of parts, the resulting assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artefacts being added to different museum instances of E78 Curated Holding over their lifespan..</rdfs:comment>

If the instance of E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an instance of E81 Transformation, i.e., a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be modelled as both an instance of E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises the events that result in the simultaneous destruction of one or more than one E18 Physical Thing and the creation of one or more than one E18 Physical Thing that preserves recognizable substance and structure from the first one(s) but has fundamentally different nature or identity.
Although the old and the new instances of E18 Physical Thing are treated as discrete entities having separate, unique identities, they are causally connected through the E81 Transformation; the destruction of the old E18 Physical Thing(s) directly causes the creation of the new one(s) using or preserving some relevant substance and structure. Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history.
Even though such instances of E81 Transformation are often motivated by a change of intended use, substantial material changes should justify the documentation of the result as a new instance of E18 Physical Thing and not just the change of function. The latter may be documented as an extended activity (instance of E7 Activity) of using it.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities formally defining new types of items.
It is typically a rigorous scholarly or scientific process that ensures a type is exhaustively described and appropriately named. In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum. The activity modelled as an instance of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a “taxon,” the type description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “original element” or “holotype”.</rdfs:comment>

It specializes the notion of activity into the curation of a collection and allows the history of curation to be recorded.
Items are accumulated and organized following criteria like subject, chronological period, material type, style of art etc. and can be added or removed from an instance of E78 Curated Holding for a specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items of a collection is regarded as an instance of E12 Production Event while the activity of evolving, preserving and promoting a collection is regarded as an instance of E87 Curation Activity.</rdfs:comment>

This class also comprises items that are “about” something in the sense of a subject. In the wider sense, this class includes expressions of psychological value such as non-figural art and musical themes.

It includes sets of signs of any nature, which may serve to designate something, or to communicate some propositional content. An instance of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary character string.
In some cases, the content of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object may completely be represented by a serialized digital content model, such as a sequence of ASCII-encoded characters, an XML or HTML document, or a TIFF image. The property P3 has note and its subproperty P190 has symbolic content allow for the description of this content model. In order to disambiguate which symbolic level is the carrier of the meaning, the property P3.1 has type can be used to specify the encoding (e.g., "bit", "Latin character", RGB pixel).</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises 4-dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical spacetime (in contrast to mathematical models of it) regardless their true geometric forms. They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, E53 Place and E52 Time-Span are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is its projection on time.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Presence</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, whose temporal extent has been chosen in order to determine the spatial extent of a phenomenon over the chosen time-span. Respective phenomena may, for instance, be historical events or periods, but can also be the diachronic extent and existence of physical things. In other words, instances of this class fix a slice of another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume in time.
The temporal extent of an instance of E93 Presence typically is predetermined by the researcher so as to focus the investigation particularly on finding the spatial extent of the phenomenon by testing for its characteristic features. There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon’s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:Class rdf:about="E96_Purchase">

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more different instances of E39 Actor, where the transferring party is completely compensated by the payment of a monetary amount. In more detail, a purchase agreement establishes a fixed monetary obligation at its initialization on the receiving party, to the giving party. An instance of E96 Purchase begins with the contract or equivalent agreement and ends with the fulfilment of all contractual obligations. In the case that the activity is abandoned before both parties have fulfilled these obligations, the activity is not regarded as an instance of E96 Purchase.
This class is a very specific case of the much more complex social business practices of exchange of goods and the creation and satisfaction of related social obligations. Purchase activities which define individual sales prices per object can be modelled by instantiating E96 Purchase for each object individually and as part of an overall instance of E96 Purchase transaction.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises the units in which a monetary system, supported by an administrative authority or other community, quantifies and arithmetically compares all monetary amounts declared in the unit. The unit of a monetary system must describe a nominal value which is kept constant by its administrative authority and an associated banking system if it exists, and not by market value. For instance, one may pay with grams of gold, but the respective monetary amount would have been agreed as the gold price in US dollars on the day of the payment. Under this definition, British Pounds, U.S. Dollars, and European Euros are examples of currency, but “grams of gold” is not. One monetary system has one and only one currency. Instances of this class must not be confused with coin denominations, such as “Dime” or “Sestertius”. Non-monetary exchange of value in terms of quantities of a particular type of goods, such as cows, do not constitute a currency.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Product Type</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>This classes comprises types that stand as the models for instances of E22 Human-Made Object that are produced as the result of production activities using plans exact enough to result in one or more series of uniform, functionally and aesthetically identical and interchangeable items. The product type is the intended ideal form of the manufacture process. It is typical of instances of E22 that conform to an instance of E99 Product Type that its component parts are interchangeable with component parts of other instances of E22 made after the model of the same instance of E99. Frequently, the uniform production according to a given instance of E99 Product Type is achieved by creating individual tools, such as moulds or print plates that are themselves carriers of the design of the product type. Modern tools may use the flexibility of electronically controlled devices to achieve such uniformity. The product type itself, i.e., the potentially unlimited series of aesthetically equivalent items, may be the target of artistic design, rather than the individual object. In extreme cases, only one instance of a product type may have been produced, such as in a "print on demand" process which was only triggered once. However, this should not be confused with industrial prototypes, such as car prototypes, which are produced prior to the production line being set up, or test the production line itself.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property allows sub typing of CIDOC CRM entities –a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus.
The CIDOC CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CIDOC CRM may by specialised into any number of sub entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E41 Appellation, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL” etc. none of which figures explicitly in the CIDOC CRM hierarchy. A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.

    <rdfs:comment>This property is a container for all informal descriptions about an object that have not been expressed in terms of CIDOC CRM constructs.
In particular, it captures the characterisation of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance etc.
Like property P2 has type (is type of), this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CIDOC CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CIDOC CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g., “construction”, “decoration” etc.
An item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.</rdfs:comment>

It is assumed that the sub-states into which the condition state is analysed form a logical whole - although the entire story may not be completely known – and that the sub-states are in fact constitutive of the general condition state. For example, a general condition state of “in ruins” may be decomposed into the individual stages of decay.

    <rdfs:comment>This property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period.
The related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.
This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place. E4 Period is a subclass of E92 Spacetime Volume. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections, that is, instances of E53 Place. Something happening at a given place can also be considered to happen at a larger place containing the first. For example, the assault on the Bastille 14-th July 1789 took place in the area covered by Paris in 1789 but also in the area covered by France in 1789.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property describes the location of an instance of E4 Period with respect to an instance of E19 Physical Object.
This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P7 took place at, E53 Place, P156i is occupied by E18 Physical Thing.
It describes a period that can be located with respect to the space defined by an E19 Physical Object such as a ship or a building. The precise geographical location of the object during the period in question may be unknown or unimportant.
For example, the French and German armistice of 22-nd June 1940 was signed in the same railway carriage as the armistice of 11-th November 1918.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property describes the active or passive participation of instances of E39 Actors in an instance of E5 Event.
It documents known events in which an instance of E39 Actor has participated during the course of that actor’s life or history. The instances of E53 Place and E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide us with constraints about the presence of the related instances of E39 Actor in the past. Collective actors, i.e., instances of E74 Group, may physically participate in events via their representing instances of E21 Persons only. The participation of multiple actors in an event is most likely an indication of their acquaintance and interaction.
The property implies that the actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. For instance, someone having been portrayed can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property describes the active or passive presence of an E77 Persistent Item in an instance of E5 Event without implying any specific role.
It documents known events in which an instance of E77 Persistent Item was present during the course of its life or history. For example, an object may be the desk, now in a museum, on which a treaty was signed. The instance of E53 Place and the instance of E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide us with constraints about the presence of the related instance E77 Persistent Item in the past. Instances of E90 Symbolic Object, in particular information objects, are physically present in events via at least one of the instances of E18 Physical Thing carrying them. Note, that the human mind can be such a carrier. A precondition for a transfer of information to a person or another new physical carrier is the presence of the respective information object and this person or physical thing in one event.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an instance of E7 Activity.
This property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.
Another example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property identifies the relationship between a preparatory activity, an instance of E7 Activity and the instance of E5 Event it is intended to be preparation for.
This includes activities, orders and other organisational actions, taken in preparation for other activities or events.
P20 had specific purpose (was purpose of) implies that an activity succeeded in achieving its aim. If it does not succeed, such as the setting of a trap that did not catch anything, one may document the unrealized intention using P21 had general purpose (was purpose of): E55 Type and/or P33 used specific technique (was used by): E29 Design or Procedure.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property identifies a specific instance of E29 Design or Procedure in order to carry out an instance of E7 Activity or parts of it.
The property differs from P32 used general technique (was technique of) in that P33 refers to an instance of E29 Design or Procedure, which is a concrete information object in its own right rather than simply being a term or a method known by tradition.
Typical examples would include intervention plans for conservation or the construction plans of a building.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.
E54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.
Dimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.
Even though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property records an instance of E54 Dimension of some instance of E70 Thing.
In the case that the recorded property is a result of a measurement of an instance of E18 Physical Thing, this property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P39i was measured by, E16 Measurement, P40 observed dimension to E54 Dimension.
It offers no information about how and when an E54 Dimension was established, nor by whom. Knowledge about an instance of E54 Dimension need not be the result of a measurement; it may be the result of evaluating data or other information, which should be documented as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment.
An instance of E54 Dimension is specific to an instance of E70 Thing.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with another instance of Physical Thing that forms part of it. The spatial extent of the composing part is included in the spatial extent of the whole.
Component elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition. An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it. For the time-span of being part of the respective whole, the component is completely contained in the place the whole occupies.
This property is intended to describe specific components that are individually documented, rather than general aspects. Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.
The instances of E57 Material of which an instance of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).
This property is transitive and asymmetric.</rdfs:comment>

More than one preferred identifier may have been assigned to an item over time.

    <rdfs:comment>This property identifies the instance of E39 Actor who has or has had custody of an instance of E18 Physical Thing at some time. This property leaves open the question if parts of this physical thing have been added or removed during the time-spans it has been under the custody of this actor, but it is required that at least a part which can unambiguously be identified as representing the whole has been under this custody for its whole time. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.
The distinction with P50 has current keeper (is current keeper of) is that P49 has former or current keeper (is former or current keeper of) leaves open the question as to whether the specified keepers are current.
This property is a shortcut for the more detailed path from E18 Physical Thing through P30i custody transferred through, E10 Transfer of Custody, P28 custody surrendered by or P29 custody received by to E39 Actor.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property records the location of an instance of E19 Physical Object at the time of validity of the record or database containing the statement that uses this property.
This property is a specialisation of P53 has former or current location (is former or current location of). It indicates that the instance of E53 Place associated with the instance of E19 Physical Object is the current location of the object. The property does not allow any indication of how long the object has been at the current location.
This property is a shortcut. A more detailed representation can make use of the fully developed (i.e., indirect) path from E19 Physical Object, through, P25i moved by, E9 Move, P26 moved to to E53 Place if and only if this Move is the most recent.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property links an instance of E19 Physical Object to an instance of E26 Physical Feature that it bears.
An instance of E26 Physical Feature can only exist on one object. One object may bear more than one E26 Physical Feature. An instance of E27 Site should be considered as an instance of E26 Physical Feature on the surface of the Earth.
An instance B of E26 Physical Feature being a detail of the structure of another instance A of E26 Physical Feature can be linked to B by use of the property P46 is composed of (forms part of). This implies that the subfeature B is P56i is found on the same E19 Physical Object as A.
This property is a shortcut. A more detailed representation can make use of the fully developed (i.e., indirect) path E19 Physical Object, through, P59 has section, E53 Place, P53i is former or current location of to E26 Physical Feature.</rdfs:comment>

This may be used as a method of checking inventory counts with regard to aggregate or collective objects. What constitutes a part or component depends on the context and requirements of the documentation. Normally, the parts documented in this way would not be considered as worthy of individual attention.
For a more complete description, objects may be decomposed into their components and constituents using P46 is composed of (forms parts of) and P45 consists of (is incorporated in). This allows each element to be described individually.</rdfs:comment>

Typically, names identifying sections of physical objects are composed of the name of a kind of part and the name of the object itself, such as "The poop deck of H.M.S. Victory", which is composed of "poop deck" and "H.M.S. Victory".</rdfs:comment>

Depicting is meant in the sense that an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing intentionally shows, through its optical qualities or form, a representation of the entity depicted. Photographs are by default regarded as being intentional in this sense. Anything that is designed to change the properties of the depiction, such as an e-book reader, is specifically excluded. The property does not pertain to inscriptions or any other information encoding.
This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item, E36 Visual Item, P138 represents to E1 CRM Entity. P62.1 mode of depiction allows the nature of the depiction to be refined.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property documents an instance of E36 Visual Item shown by an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.
This property is similar to P62 depicts (is depicted by) in that it associates an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing with a visual representation. However, P65 shows visual item (is shown by) differs from the P62 depicts (is depicted by) property in that it makes no claims about what the instance of E36 Visual Item is deemed to represent. An instance of E36 Visual Item identifies a recognisable image or visual symbol, regardless of what this image may or may not represent.
For example, all recent British coins bear a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, a fact that is correctly documented using P62 depicts (is depicted by). Different portraits have been used at different periods, however. P65 shows visual item (is shown by) can be used to refer to a particular portrait.
P65 shows visual item (is shown by) may also be used for Visual Items such as signs, marks and symbols, for example the 'Maltese Cross' or the 'copyright symbol’ that have no particular representational content.
This property is part of the fully developed path E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, P65 shows visual item, E36 Visual Item, P138 represents to E1 CRM Entity which is shortcut by, P62 depicts (is depicted by).</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property generalises relationships like whole-part, sequence, prerequisite or inspired by between instances of E29 Design or Procedure. Any instance of E29 Design or Procedure may be associated with other designs or procedures. The property is considered to be symmetrical unless otherwise indicated by P69.1 has type. The property is not transitive
This property is a directed relationship. The P69.1 has type property of P69 has association with allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc.
Instances of this property are considered to be symmetric, in case no directed sense is provided for them by the property P69.1 has type.
The property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E52 Time-Span with an instance of E61 Time Primitive specifying a minimum period of time covered by it. Since Time-Spans may not have precisely known temporal extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about the minimum and maximum temporal extents of Time-Spans. This property allows a Time-Span’s minimum temporal extent (i.e., its inner boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed. If different sources of evidence justify different minimum extents without contradicting each other, the smallest interval including all these extents will be the best estimate. This should be taken into account for information integration.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property links an instance of E64 End of Existence to the instance of E77 Persistent Item taken out of existence by it.
In the case of immaterial things, the instance of E64 End of Existence is considered to take place with the destruction of the last physical carrier.
This allows an “end” to be attached to any instance of E77 Persistent Item being documented i.e., instances of E70 Thing, E72 Legal Object, E39 Actor, E41 Appellation and E55 Type. For many instances of E77 Persistent Item we know the maximum life-span and can infer that they must have ended to exist. We assume in that case an instance of E64 End of Existence, which may be as unnoticeable as forgetting the secret knowledge by the last representative of some indigenous nation.</rdfs:comment>

This may well be different from the intended functional purpose of the instance of E70 Thing (which can be documented with P103 was intended for (was intention of)). For example, it could be recorded that a particular wooden crate had a general use as a shelf support on a market stall even though it had been originally intended for carrying vegetables.
The use of this property is intended to allow the documentation of usage patterns attested in historical records or through scientific investigation (for instance ceramic residue analysis). It should not be used to document the intended, and thus assumed, use of an object.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This symmetric property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place geometrically overlapping it.
It does not specify anything about the shared area. This property is purely spatial. It does not imply that phenomena that define, by their extent, places related by P121 overlaps with have ever covered a common area at the same time or even coexisted. In contrast, spatiotemporal overlaps described by P132 spatiotemporally overlaps are the total of areas simultaneously covered by the related spacetime volumes.

    <rdfs:comment>This property identifies an instance E90 Symbolic Object carried by an instance of E18 Physical Thing. Since an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is defined as an immaterial idealization over potentially multiple carriers, any individual realization on a particular physical carrier may be defective, due to deterioration or shortcomings in the process of creating the realization compared to the intended ideal. As long as such defects do not substantially affect the complete recognition of the respective symbolic object, it is still regarded as carrying an instance of this E90 Symbolic Object. If these defects are of scholarly interest, the particular realization can be modelled as an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. Note, that any instance of E90 Symbolic Object incorporated (P165) in the carried symbolic object is also carried by the same instance of E18 Physical Thing.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property generalises the notions of "copy of" and "similar to" into a directed relationship, where the domain expresses the derivative or influenced item and the range the source or influencing item, if such a direction can be established. The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.
The P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”.
If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e., that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.

    <rdfs:comment>This property identifies one or more instances of E1 CRM Entity that were used as evidence to declare a new instance of E55 Type.
The examination of these items is often the only objective way to understand the precise characteristics of a new type. Such items should be deposited in a museum or similar institution for that reason. The taxonomic role renders the specific relationship of each item to the type, such as "holotype" or "original element".</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E1 CRM Entity with an instance of E55 Type for which it has been declared to be a particularly characteristic example.
The P137.1 in the taxonomic role property of P137 exemplifies (is exemplified by) allows differentiation of taxonomic roles. The taxonomic role renders the specific relationship of this example to the type, such as "prototypical", "archetypical", "lectotype", etc. The taxonomic role "lectotype" is not associated with the instance of E83 Type Creation itself but is selected in a later phase.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property establishes the relationship between an instance of E36 Visual Item and the instance of E1 CRM Entity that it visually represents.
Any entity may be represented visually. This property is part of the fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which is shortcut by P62 depicts (is depicted by). P138.1 mode of representation allows the nature of the representation to be refined.
This property is also used for the relationship between an original and a digitisation of the original by the use of techniques such as digital photography, flatbed or infrared scanning. Digitisation is here seen as a process with a mechanical, causal component rendering the spatial distribution of structural and optical properties of the original and does not necessarily include any visual similarity identifiable by human observation.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E41 Appellation with another instance of E41 Appellation that constitutes a derivative or variant of the former and that may also be used for identifying items identified by the former, in suitable contexts, independent from the particular item to be identified. This property should not be confused with additional variants of names used characteristically for a single, particular item, such as individual nicknames. It is a directed relationship, where the range expresses the derivative or variant and the domain the source of derivation or original form of variation, if such a direction can be established. Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric.
Multiple names assigned to an object, which do not apply to all things identified with the specific instance of E41 Appellation, should be modelled as repeated values of P1 is identified by (identifies) of this object.
P139.1 has type allows the type of derivation to be refined, for instance “transliteration from Latin 1 to ASCII”.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property describes the largest volume in space, an instance of E53 Place, that an instance of E18 Physical Thing has occupied at any time during its existence, with respect to the reference space relative to the physical thing itself. This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.
This property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.
In contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds:
It does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.
It identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time-span.
If the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E53 Place with the instance of E18 Physical Thing that determines a reference space for this instance of E53 Place by being at rest with respect to this reference space. The relative stability of form of an instance of E18 Physical Thing defines its default reference space. The reference space is not spatially limited to the referred thing. For example, a ship determines a reference space in terms of which other ships in its neighbourhood may be described. Larger constellations of matter, such as continental plates, may comprise many physical features that are at rest with them and define the same reference space.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E53 Place that is the result of the spatial projection of the instance of the E92 Spacetime Volume on a reference space.
In general, there can be more than one useful reference space (for reference space see P156 occupies and P157 is at rest relative to) to describe the spatial projection of a spacetime volume, for example, in describing a sea battle, the difference between the battle ship and the seafloor as reference spaces. Thus, it can be seen that the projection is not unique.
The spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volumes which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.
In case the domain of an instance of P161 has spatial projection is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire.
This property is part of the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place, which in turn is implied by P156 occupies (is occupied by).
This property is part of the fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place, which in turn is shortcut by P7 took place at (witnessed).</rdfs:comment>

There are two typical cases for the determination of the related instance of E52 Time-Span. In the first, it is the temporal extent of an instance of E2 Temporal Entity (documented with P4 has time-span (is time-span of)): this then documents the simultaneity of the instance of E93 Presence and the instance of E2 Temporal Entity, even if the absolute time-span is not known, and can be regarded as a phenomenal time-span. In the second, the instance of E52 Time-Span is a date range declared in or derived from historical sources or provided by dating methods: this is a declarative time-span.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E73 Information Object with an instance of E90 Symbolic Object (or any of its subclasses) that was included in it.
This property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated signs, which were created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many instances of E73 Information Object, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.
It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.
In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.
When restricted to information objects, that is, seen as a property with E73 Information Object as domain and range the property is transitive.
A digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of a manuscript page, if the respective text is defined as a sequence of symbols of a particular type, such as Latin characters, and the resolution and quality of the digital image is sufficient to resolve these symbols so they are readable on the digital image.
This property is asymmetric.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment with the type of property or relation that this assignment maintains to hold between the item to which it assigns an attribute and the attribute itself. Note that the properties defined by the CIDOC CRM also constitute instances of E55 Type themselves. The direction of the assigned property of type is understood to be from the attributed item (the range of property P140 assigned attribute to) to the attribute item (the range of the property P141 assigned). More than one property type may be assigned to hold between two items.
A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place, which is defined in the same reference space, and which is used to approximate the former. The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.
In common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g., in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g., if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge.
In more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.

This property only applies to instances of E90 Symbolic Object that can be represented completely in this form. The representation may be more specific than the symbolic level defining the identity condition of the represented. This depends on the type of the symbolic object represented. For instance, if a name has type "Modern Greek character sequence", it may be represented in a loss-free Latin transcription, meaning however the sequence of Greek letters.
As another example, if the represented object has type "English words sequence", American English or British English spelling variants may be chosen to represent the English word "colour" without defining a different symbolic object. If a name has type "European traditional name", no particular string may define its content.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume that constitutes the complete trajectory of its geometric extent through spacetime for the whole time of the existence of the instance of E18 Physical Thing.
An instance of E18 Physical Thing not only occupies a particular geometric space at each instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime, i.e., the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume this property associates it with. This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the E92 Spacetime Volume depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr &amp;amp; Hiebel, 2013).
Included in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This property relates one instance of E18 Physical Thing which acts as a container or support to a supported or contained instance of E18 Physical Thing. Typical examples of E18 Physical Things which are intended to function as a container or support include shelves, folders or boxes. These containers or supports provide a stable surface which is intended for other physical objects to be placed upon for storage, display, transport or other similar functions.
This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P59 has section, E53 Place, P53i is former or current location of, to E18 Physical Thing. It is not a sub-property of P46 is composed of, as the held or supported object is not a component of the container or support.
This property can be used to avoid explicitly instantiating the E53 Place which is defined by an instance of E18 Physical Thing, especially when the only intended use of that instance of E18 Physical Thing is to act as a container or surface for the storage of other instances of E18 Physical Thing. The place’s existence is defined by the existence of the container or surface, and will go out of existence at the same time as the destruction of the container or surface.
This property is transitive. This property is asymmetric.</rdfs:comment>
