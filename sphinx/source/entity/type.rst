Types are used to add information or group entities. They are hierarchical and can be accessed and
edited via the **Types** :doc:`/ui/menu` item. With this feature the model and user interface can be
adapted for specific research interests.

* You can checked **untyped entities** at the type overview with clicking the **show** link
* Type descriptions are shown in forms as a mouse over text at the **i** icon

Standard types

custom type **Sex** which is used for actor.

* Can be used for multiple classes,  e.g. a hierarchy "importance" for places, actors and groups
