Reference System
================

.. toctree::

CIDOC documentation:
:cidoc_entity:`E32 Authority Document<e32-authority-document>`

For step by step instructions have a look at our
:doc:`/examples/reference_systems`.

Reference systems can be used to link entities to external sources, e.g. to
`Wikidata <https://www.wikidata.org/>`_  or
`GeoNames <https://www.geonames.org/>`_
which are already included in the default application. You can see a list of
available systems by clicking the **Reference system** button on the start
page. Links consists of an identifier (ID) and a precision.

ID
--
The identifier of the entity in the external reference system. For GeoNames
and Wikidata it will be checked for a valid format.

Precision
---------
When linking to an external reference a precision is required. Available
options are the `SKOS <https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/>`_ based definitions
of the confidence degree that concepts can be used interchangeable.

* **Close match**: Concepts are sufficiently similar that they can be used
  interchangeably in some information retrieval applications
* **Exact match**: High degree of confidence that the concepts can be used
  interchangeably

E.g. if a historical project links the city of Vienna to Wikidata, a
**close match** would be more suitable, because the Wikidata entry is more
about the current city and not the historical one.

Configuration
-------------
Admins and manager can add, update and delete external reference systems.

* **Name** - e.g. Wikipedia; can not be changed for Wikidata or GeoNames
* **Website URL** - an URL to the project site of the reference system
* **Resolver URL** - an URL that can be linked to in combination with an ID,
  e.g. the resolver URL **https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/** would create
  together with a **Q123**
  identifier the external link: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123
* **Example ID** - an example id to show the desired format e.g. Q123
  for Wikidata
* **External reference match** - default precision selected in forms
* **Description** - a short description, shown in forms when mouse over
  the **i** icon
* **Classes** - a checkbox list of available classes, for GeoNames only place
  is available

Classes can be removed from a system by clicking on the tab with the
corresponding class name and clicking the **Remove** button. This button is
only available if there are no entities of this class linked to the reference
system.

Reference systems can be deleted only if no classes are attached to it.
Wikidata and GeoNames are integrated and cannot be deleted but if desired they
can be disabled by removing the classes.
