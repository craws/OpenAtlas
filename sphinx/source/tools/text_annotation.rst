Text annotation
===============

.. toctree::

The text annotation feature allows for marking text in a
:doc:`/entity/source` (or source text) adding a comment and/or link to an
entity. In that way the mention of a person, place, event ... can be linked to
an entity in OpenAtlas.

Usage
-----
A text can be annotated when adding or updating a :doc:`/entity/source`
(or source text) with following steps:

* Mark the specific text part in the source with the left mouse button
* Click the **Annotate** button above the text field
* Select the entity which is related to the annotation and/or add a comment
* Click on add
* Press the save button of the form to submit it

After that the text annotations is also visible in the source detail view:

* Links to other entities are displayed
* With mouse over you can read the comments

Current Limitations
-------------------

* Only entities that are already linked with the source can be chosen for
  annotation
* It is not possible to annotate over line breaks
* Labels and messages of the annotation tool are available only in English
