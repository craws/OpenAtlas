Network visualization
=====================

.. toctree::

With the integration of `D3.js <https://d3js.org/>`_ data can be visualized as
a network graph available at the **Network visualization** button at the
:doc:`/overview`. **Classic** is the default view but it can be switched to
other types at the top of the visualization pages.

In case of performance issues
-----------------------------
* Check if your browser has hardware acceleration enabled
* Try different browsers, some are faster than others when dealing with large
  data sets

Download
--------
If an image is available (classic mode only) you can download it as PNG.
Be aware that the resulting image is exactly what you see in this moment so
you may want to change width and height in the options before. Also you may
want to choose a zoom level where labels are readable.
