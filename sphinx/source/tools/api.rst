API
===

.. toctree::

The OpenAtlas API
(`Application programming interface <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>`_)
output is based on `JSON-LD syntax <https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/>`_
and `GeoJSON <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946>`_, and therefore could be rendered in many web
mapping applications. In addition, `Linked Places <https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places>`_
was used as standard.

The API links in the user interface are only visible for user with activated **advanced layout** in
their :doc:`profile` but any logged in user has access to the API.

The base url of the current OpenAtlas API is :doc:`/api/0.2/`

Settings: :doc:`/admin/api`

Documentation: :doc:`/apidocs`
