Search

.. toctree::

To allow quick navigation, even in a big data set, the global full-text search
can find entities containing the search term in their name or aliases. It is:

* Not case sensitive, e.g. **aDa lovelacE** will find **Ada Lovelace**
* Full text, e.g. **da Love** will find **Ada Lovelace**
* Unaccented, e.g. **Lovē** will find **Love** and vice-versa
* You can use *%* as a placeholder, e.g. **Ada L%ce** will
  find **Ada Lovelace**

Additionally, a refined advanced search can be used to filter the results
where more options are available:

* **Only entities edited by me** - show only entities which you have created or
  edited.
* **Also search in description** - searches in description and date comments
* **Classes** - search only in selected classes, e.g. Place

* **Dates**

  * This filter is only active if at least the **from** or **to** year is
    filled out.
  * If only a year is provide the **from** date will be **YYYY-01-01**,
    the **to** date will be **YYYY-12-31**
  * If only a year and a month is provided it will be the last of this month.
  * If the option **Include dateless entities** is checked, entities without
    dates will be found too.

Because entities can have up to 4 date values (time span for begin and time
span for end) they will be added to the result if at least one date meets the
criteria. E.g. a person that lived from **1540 to 1560** will be found when
the **from year** value is **1550**.
