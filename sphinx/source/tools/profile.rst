Presentation site
-----------------
URLs regarding a presentation site can be set/overridden by users. This
can be useful e.g. in case multiple projects are sharing an instance but use
different presentation sites for their data.

* **Website URL** - address of the presentation site, e.g.
  https://frontend-demo.openatlas.eu/. A link to the website will be displayed
  at the backend's overview page
* **Resolver URL** - if entity details can be viewed by using the id at
  the end of an URL, a resolver URL can be specified. Example: with the
  resolver URL https://example.net/entities/ a link for the presentation site
  view of an entity would be shown in the backend and would look like this:
  https://example.net/entities/1234
