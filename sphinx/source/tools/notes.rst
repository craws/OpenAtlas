Notes

.. toctree::*

**Notes** are an additional tool for your workflow, e.g. to add a personal reminder to an entity.
They are not part of the :doc:`data model</model>` and won't show in presentation sites or be archived.

   * Notes can be added at the notes tab when viewing an entity
   * Notes will be displayed at the entity view and at the :doc:`/overview`
   * Notes set to private (default) are only visible to you, public can be seen by everybody
   * Notes will get deleted if the entity is deleted by you or anybody else
   * Admins or manager can set notes of other users to private (e.g. in case they got inactive)
