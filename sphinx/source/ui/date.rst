CIDOC based OpenAtlas shortcuts: OA8 (begins in) and OA9 (ends in)

Date input fields in forms are initially hidden and can be shown with
clicking on **Show** beside the **Date** label.

To manage uncertainty in time up to 4 dates can be used: a time span for the
beginning and a time span for the ending. You find detailed examples here:
:doc:`/examples/time_spans`

**Exact date**

For example if you knew the exact birth of an actor you could enter
**1356-12-23** in the first row.

**Time span**

If you are unsure e.g when a Church was destroyed you could use both end
dates. Chose a wide enough
span where you are sure it had happened, e.g. the fist decade of 1800.

* enter in the first end year: **1800**
* enter in the second end year: **1809**

Missing days and months are filled out so that the result will be
**1800-01-01** to **1809-12-31**.

**Input values**

* **Year**: -4713 to 9999 but not zero
* **Month**: 1 to 12
* **Day**: 1 to 31
* **Comment**: a text field for additional information for begin or end

Additional fields if the time module is activated in :doc:`/tools/profile` or
a time was already entered:

* **Hour**: 0 to 23
* **Minute**: 0 to 59
* **Second**: 0 to 59

**Background**

Dates will be validated so you can just try if you aren't sure about a leap
year or similar. Most limitations come from the database
`PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ which in turn uses the
`Proleptic Gregorian calendar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar>`_.
So there is no year zero (one year before year 1 is the year 1 BC).
