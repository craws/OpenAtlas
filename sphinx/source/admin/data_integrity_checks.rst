Data integrity checks
=====================

.. toctree::

The quality of data is very important to us. Although ultimately the data
responsibility lies with editors and project managers we take great care to
avoid entering of inconsistent data on a technical level, e.g. with the user
interface it is not possible to enter begin dates which are later than end
dates.

Nevertheless mistakes can happen, not only on the application level but also
e.g. when importing data from other projects or deleting files outside of the
application. Because data integrity is important for the quality of research we
implemented functions to check possible inconsistencies which are described in
detail below.

Orphans
-------

Orphans
*******
In this tab entries like dates which are not linked are shown. They could be
artifacts from imports or bugs and can be deleted. If they seem to appear
regularly again (without imports or known bugs) please report that issue.

Entities without links
**********************
Entries shown have no relation to other entities. That could be ok but maybe
they are artifacts or were forgotten to link.

Type
****
These types were created but have no sub types or associated data. Maybe they
originate from thefirst install or were never used.

Missing files
*************
Here are listed file entities which have no corresponding file, most likely
because the file itself doesn't exist anymore.

Orphaned files
**************
Files that have no corresponding entity are listed here.

Orphaned subunits
*****************
Subunits that are missing a connection to the level above. E.g. a feature
without a connection to a place.

Circular dependencies
*********************
A check if an entity is linked to itself. This could happen e.g. if a person is
married to herself or a type has itself as super. It shouldn't be possible to
create circular dependencies within the application. Nevertheless it's a useful
check for e.g. if data is imported from other systems.

Check dates
-----------
In this tab invalid date combinations are shown, e.g. begin dates which are
later than end dates. These entries should be cleared up otherwise they cannot
be updated because the user interface won't allow saving entries with invalid
date combinations.

Check links
-----------
With this function every link will be checked for CIDOC validity. Depending on
the amount of data this could take some time. Data entered with the OpenAtlas
user interface should always be CIDOC valid but in case of e.g. imported
data this check should be used afterwards. If invalid links are found they
should be dealt with outside the application.

Check link duplicates
---------------------
There are actually two checks:

The first one checks for duplicate links which are identically and can be
safely deleted when clicking the *Delete link duplicates* button.

In case the first test found no duplicate links it will be checked for entities
connected multiple times two a type which is defined for single use. E.g. a
place has the type castle and city. In this case you would only see one in the
user interface and the other one would get deleted in case anybody updates the
entry. Here you have the option to look at these and remove the wrong ones
clicking on the **Remove** link beside the entries in the last column.

Both checks shouldn't find anything wrong with data entered with the
application but nevertheless it could happen because of imports or unknown bugs.

Check similar names
-------------------
Here you can search for similar names. Depending on selection and data volume
this might take some time.

* **Classes** - select the class which you want to search for similar names
* **Ratio** - select how similar the names should be, 100 is the default and
  means absolute identical

The function uses the `fuzzywuzzy <https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/>`_
package is used which in turn uses the
`Levenshtein Distance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance>`_.
