API

Description: :doc:`/technical/api`

* **Public** (default=off). If you turn it on the API and linked files with a license can be accessed even without logging in. This might be useful if you want the data open anyway to allow other systems to use it.

**Note**: The API and files linked to a license can still be requested from:

- a browser, where a user is logged in
- if the IP of the request-computer is on the **IP Whitelist**
